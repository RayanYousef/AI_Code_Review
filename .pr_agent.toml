STRICTLY enforce all rules from AGENTS.md located in Assets/AGENTS.md.

For every violation found, output:
VIOLATION: [Category]
LINE(S): [line numbers]
ISSUE: [explanation]
SOLUTION: [corrected code]
GUIDELINE: [AGENTS.md section reference]

Check ALL violations:
1. Type declarations: All 'var' must be replaced with explicit types
2. Naming conventions: PascalCase for classes/methods, _camelCase for private fields, camelCase for locals
3. Single responsibility: Each function must have only ONE responsibility
4. SOLID principles: Check Open/Closed, Liskov, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion
5. DRY principle: No code duplication
6. CQS: Methods must either command (modify state) OR query (return data), not both
7. Explicit visibility modifiers: Always specify private/public
8. Boolean naming: Start with Is/Has/Did
9. Event naming: End with "Callback"
10. Button methods: Start with "OnButtonClick_"
11. Unity methods: Awake/Start/Update must NOT be public
12. LINQ in loops: Flag and suggest for-loops instead
13. GetComponent: Prefer [SerializeField], only use GetComponent for runtime objects
14. Serialization: Use '[SerializeField] private' format
15. Zero Garbage Collection: Avoid allocations in Update loops
